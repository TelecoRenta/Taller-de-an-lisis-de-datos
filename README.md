Workshop title: ***Understanding the Cloud through data analysis***

This workshop focuses on explaining how we can process and analyze data obtained from measurements. The measurements that we use are obtained from RIPE Atlas, but the content of this workshop is valid for any other measurement data.

The workshop is supported by three types of files: 
1. **PDF guides** that consist in one guide for the instructor and another guide for the student following this workshop 
2. **Jupyter Notebooks** that contain the code that run the code that we want to generate, either to create measurements 
3. ***Data files***, which are json files containing the required data to run the code in the notebooks.

## Procedure


Please, start by reading the PDF guide file that corresponds to your role:


+ `GUIDE_instructor.pdf`
+ `GUIDE_student.pdf`


The guide will explain you the context of the workshop, the motivation, and how to navigate the code. 
While reading the guide, you will be invited to open the Jupyter Notebook to follow the instructions that they contain to proceed with the workshop. 


There is a single Jupyter Notebook:

+ `latency2_cloudDataAnalysis.ipynb`

This notebook is self-explained and contains details that describe and comment all the steps that are applied. 

We provide the data of some RIPE Atlas measurements as an example. Of course, the input data can be substituted by other measurements. The examples are provided in the JSON files: 

- `RIPE-ATLAS-measurement-nnnnnnnn.json`

where nnnnnnnn = "48819905", "48819907", "48819909" are measurements of PING packets 
and   nnnnnnnn = "48819906", "48819908", "48819910" are measurements of TRACEROUTE packets
